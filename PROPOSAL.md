Project proposal

I'm thinking of making a program that contains the option to play multiple board games like snakes and ladder, ludo, connect-4 (games that are not that complicated to implement) in one interface. So the user will basically have a couple of board games to choose from and then they can proceed to play that game, or switch to some other game.

I don't really have much background information with how to implement the visuals for this games but I can hopefully read up something and figure it out. I've always thought it would be really cool to have a virtual board(like a digital screen) instead of a board made out of cardboard. And you can move your pieces by dragging it on the "board" to the respective position. So basically, you can play any board game you would like with just that particular board. This is probably too complicated to implement, so I'll just stick to doing this on a smaller scale on a computer screen.

I would hopefully be done with the coding for the individual games by the end of week 1. I would then try to build the visual component by week 2. And for week 3, I'll be trying to integrate all of them together to provide a common interface. If I were to finish the project early, I woul try to include more features or more board games if possible.
